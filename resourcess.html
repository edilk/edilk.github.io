				<h2 class="resource-h2">Access Is Now On My Resource Library!!!</h2>
				<p class="resource-p">The world is quickly moving into an all-digital age. There is less and less need for hard copies of catalogs and brochures.

				<h2 class="resource-h2">Making Signage Simple</h2>
				<p class="resource-p">In every blog we post and in every email we send, you will normally see the phrase "make signage simple" or some variation of it. Chances are if you've spoken to us in person or over the phone we've said it too. But what do we really mean when we say this? What does it really mean to "make signage simple"?   The answer to that is actually quite simple. The custom signage industry offers endless possibilities when it comes to signage. You can create nearly any type of sign imaginable for your facility. That solution is excellent for many customers, but not for everyone. What about the group of customers who aren't looking for something extravagant or custom made and just need a simple workstation sign? That's our specialty. Having endless choices can be overwhelming for those unfamiliar with the signage industry. We simplify the entire process by having multiple catalogs filled with...</p>

				<h2 class="resource-h2">Wayfinding Signage: Basics</h2>
				<p class="resource-p">Wayfinding is described as the ability to navigate through an environment. It is often an overlooked or less thought out portion of construction in a building. It may, in fact, be one of the most important aspects of the completed facility. People need to know where to go once they are in the building and an effective wayfinding program is a way to solve that issue. In this post, we'll be describing the basics of wayfinding programs. Keys to a Wayfinding Program Simplicity for the visitor -Don't make the visitors have to think where to go. The program should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Consistency -The entire program should be consistent. The typeface, colors, and design should remain the same to prevent any confusion from visitors. Orientation -Showing a visitor where they currently are and where their destination is located is an effective way of orientating the visitor to the environment and simplifying their navigation. Maps are a commonly...</p>

				<h2 class="resource-h2">Access Healthcare</h2>
				<p class="resource-p">Signage in the Healthcare Environment Healthcare facilities are ever changing; expanding and remodeling with new discoveries in medicine. The ability to effectively communicate the locations of departments, offices and patient rooms cannot be overstated. It can truly make or break someone’s experience in a facility. We understand this and have created a catalog of signs that will make this process go smoothly.   Our approach to your healthcare facility is to help visitors and staff navigate through your environment. This is done by analyzing how your facility is laid out and using this information to create an Interior Wayfinding Sign Program. We can also add to your signs to make them uniquely represent the style and design of your facility.   Once your wayfinding sign program is created we make the process of buying and implementing the signs as easy as possible. Our Healthcare Catalog is complete with directory, directional, identification and regulatory signs. Included in...</p>

				<h2 class="resource-h2">Access Residential</h2>
				<p class="resource-p">Elegant Design with a Simple Product   Residential buildings are not like other large facilities. They’re not business offices or medical facilities where you only spend a few hours at a time. They are the homes and communities we spend our lives in. In order to design and create wayfinding programs for these buildings you must have a deep understanding of community living. Here at Access Sign Systems we have made it a priority to realize this and apply what we know to these buildings.   Creating the signage for residential buildings comes down to designing a system that is both comfortable and simple to understand while remaining true to the brand of your facility. The system is organized in pre-designed configurations with standard color palettes to minimize the decision process. We are also able to customize the top portion of these signs with whatever design works best for you. Access has the know-how...</p>

				<h2 class="resource-h2">Introducing Access Identity</h2>
				<p class="resource-p">A New Sign Solution For Brand Identity One of the many challenges faced by a company when designing their facility is how to properly display their brand. Your brand is unique and encapsulates the vision of your company. Your sign should reinforce that vision and display it for all to see.   When creating a design and selecting materials to use with your sign you have to understand both the brand and the space in which the sign will go. That's where Access Identity comes in. Our system allows your brand to be easily visible wherever you decide to place it.   In these six easy steps we can design and create an eye-catching sign to fit the needs and vision of your company. Similar to our Concierge Service, let us do the work for you! Simply send us your brand and the dimensions of the desired location and let us create the design. All you...</p>
